Simon is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to recall and repeat sequences of flashing lights and sounds. The game starts with a single color lighting up, and the player must tap the correct button to match it. With each turn, Simon adds another step to the sequence, making it progressively harder. The goal is to remember and repeat the longest sequence possible without making a mistake. It's a fun and addictive way to test memory, concentration, and reflexes!
